        <p>1.Write HTML code that shows the following test:</p>
        <p><b>Theorem:</b>:Every prime number(greater than 2)<em>module</em> 4 can be written in the form <em>4n + 1</em>
            or <em>4n + 3</em></p>
        <p><b>Proof</b>:Any number p when divided by 4 leaves remainder 0,1,2 or 3. Therefore,the number has the form 4n, 4n + 1, 4n + 2
        or 4n + 3<em>. Since <em>4n</em> and 4n + 2</em>are <br><strong>even </strong>, so thse can not be a form of a prime number which is an <strong>odd</strong>number(except 2).this proves the theorem.&#9744;</p>
