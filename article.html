        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Equations involving two variables are common in mathematics and can represent various real-life scenarios. Solving such equations requires understanding algebraic concepts and techniques. This guide will walk you through the steps to solve equations in two variables.</p>

        <h2>Steps to Solve Equations in Two Variables:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Identify the Variables:</strong> Determine which variables are involved in the equation. Common variables used are 'x' and 'y'.</li>
            <li><strong>Isolate One Variable:</strong> Choose one variable and isolate it on one side of the equation.</li>
            <li><strong>Substitute:</strong> Substitute the expression for the isolated variable into the other equation(s) to create an equation with only one variable.</li>
            <li><strong>Solve for the Variable:</strong> Solve the equation obtained in the previous step to find the value of the variable.</li>
            <li><strong>Repeat if Necessary:</strong> If there are multiple variables, repeat steps 2-4 until all variables are solved for.</li>
            <li><strong>Check Your Solution:</strong> Verify the solution by substituting the values back into the original equations to ensure they satisfy all conditions.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Example Problem:</h2>
        <p>Let's solve the system of equations:</p>
        <p><strong>Equation 1:</strong> 3x + 2y = 8</p>
        <p><strong>Equation 2:</strong> 2x - y = 4</p>
        <h3>Solution:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Isolate 'y' in Equation 1:</strong> <code>y = (8 - 3x) / 2</code></li>
            <li><strong>Substitute 'y' into Equation 2:</strong> <code>2x - ((8 - 3x) / 2) = 4</code></li>
            <li><strong>Solve for 'x':</strong> After simplification, <code>x = 2</code></li>
            <li><strong>Substitute 'x' into Equation 1:</strong> <code>3(2) + 2y = 8</code> becomes <code>6 + 2y = 8</code></li>
            <li><strong>Solve for 'y':</strong> After simplification, <code>y = 1</code></li>
        </ol>
        <p>Thus, the solution to the system of equations is <code>x = 2</code> and <code>y = 1</code>.</p>

        <h2>Programming Solution:</h2>
        <p>Below is a Python program that can solve equations in two variables:</p>
        <pre><code>def solve_equations(eq1, eq2):
    x = symbols('x')
    y = symbols('y')
    solution = solve((eq1, eq2), (x, y))
    return solution

# Example usage:
eq1 = 3*x + 2*y - 8
eq2 = 2*x - y - 4
solution = solve_equations(eq1, eq2)
print(solution)
        </code></pre>
        <p>This Python program uses the SymPy library to solve the system of equations symbolically.</p>
